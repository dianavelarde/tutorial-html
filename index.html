    <p>George Luca thought that the secene between <strong>Han Solo</strong> and Greedo in the Cantina made Han cold blooded. Lets think bout the original scene, shall we? Greedo the bounty hunder is holding hand at gun point and says in his gurgly voice he is goin to kill him and shoots Greedo through the tabe before Greedo can blow Han a new smuggling hatch. That makes Han <em>cool, not</em> cold.</p>
